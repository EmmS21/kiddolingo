# AI-Powered Language Learning for Children

## Problem Statement
Learning a new language requires total immersion, but traditional methods often fail to engage children effectively. The most successful language acquisition happens when learners are fully immersed in contexts they find interesting and enjoyable. For children specifically, it is imperative that this process is engaging to ensure high retention and continued interest in learning.

## Solution
An interactive AI-powered language learning platform specifically designed for children that:
- Creates personalized learning experiences based on each child's interests
- Facilitates natural conversations in the target language
- Makes learning fun and engaging through topics children actually care about
- Provides real-time feedback and corrections
- Maintains dual-language communication for better understanding

## How It Works
