# Questions for AI Engineer â€“ Voice Integration Feature

I'm in the process of integrating the voice feature in our FastAPI backend, but I'm noticing some missing details compared to the working sample you shared. Could you please help clarify the following?

1. **Transcription Implementation:**
   - I don't see a working `transcribe` function in the sample code. How is transcription implemented in the working sample?
   - Are we using a custom wrapper around OpenAI's Whisper API, or another tool/library? Please share the complete transcription workflow.
   - What is the expected audio format for transcription (e.g., raw PCM, WAV, sample rate, channel configuration)? Are any preprocessing steps required?

2. **Voice Processing Pipeline:**
   - We have a `voice_processor.py` service that's supposed to handle the audio processing pipeline. Could you explain how this file integrates with the WebSocket endpoint (in `voice.py`)?
   - Are both the direct endpoint code and the dedicated service used simultaneously? If not, which one is the source of truth in our working sample?

3. **Chat Completion Integration:**
   - For generating the tutoring response, the sample references the realtime model identifier `"gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17"`. Is this the confirmed model to use? Are there any additional configurations or parameters needed to ensure reliable operation?
   - Is there any specific context management (or message history buffering) that we need to include to support conversation context as seen in the sample?

4. **Text-to-Speech Conversion:**
   - How is the TTS feature implemented in the working sample? What audio format and encoding should we expect from the TTS response?
   - Are there any additional parameters or settings (e.g., voice selection details) that are critical for the TTS call?

5. **Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and Interruption Handling:**
   - The documentation and some code comments mention handling interruptions and VAD. Could you provide details or working sample code on how VAD is configured and used in our solution?
   - Should we implement any special casing in the WebSocket handling code for real-time interruptions?

6. **Connection Management & Heartbeat:**
   - The current implementation includes a heartbeat mechanism in the `VoiceConnectionManager`, but the working sample code for a single-request response doesn't show this. Is the heartbeat essential for our use case or can it be streamlined for one-shot audio processing?
   - Are there any nuances in connection cleanup or error recovery from the working sample that we might have overlooked?

7. **Configuration & Environment:**
   - Are there any specific environment variables (in `.env` or elsewhere) or configuration settings that we need to be aware of to successfully run the realtime endpoints with OpenAI?
   - Is there any caching or additional middleware used in the working sample that improves reliability or performance?

Your guidance on these points will help ensure that our implementation fully aligns with the working sample and all critical components are properly integrated. Please provide as much detail as possible.

Thank you!
